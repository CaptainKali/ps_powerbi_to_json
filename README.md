# ps_powerbi_to_json

## How it works
It parses Power Query queries, their names, Power Query Editor groups, and some additional properties from a PBIT file. Then it transforms all the parsed information into a form which is used by Power BI Dataflows. It is a JSON file used for import/export of dataflows.

## How to use it
1. Export an PBIX file as PBIT
2. Run the powershell and get your generated JSON 
```sh
.\pbit_to_json.ps1 <name_of_your_PBIT_file>
```
3. Import the JSON as Dataflow in Power BI Service
